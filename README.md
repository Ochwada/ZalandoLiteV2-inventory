##  About Inventory Service
The **Inventory Service** is a core component of the ZalandoLite V2 backend system, responsible for managing and tracking 
product stock levels. It maintains an up-to-date record of inventory for each product and exposes a set of RESTful 
endpoints to enable the following operations:

- **Create Inventory Records**: Add initial stock levels when a new product is introduced. 
- **Update Inventory**: Modify stock quantities in response to orders, returns, or restocking. 
- **Retrieve Inventory Data**: Fetch current stock levels for real-time availability checks.

This service plays a critical role in enabling seamless interactions across the ecosystem, particularly by supporting
**real-time stock validation** for services like the **Product Service and Order Service**. By decoupling inventory 
logic into its own microservice, the system ensures scalability, separation of concerns, and efficient inventory 
control across the platform.
### Key Responsibilities
1. **Track stock per product**: Maintains quantity and stock status for each individual product. 
2. **Real-time stock visibility**: Enables other services (e.g., Product Service, Order Service) to query available inventory before placing or processing orders. 
3. **CRUD operations for inventory**: Allows the creation and updating of stock data.

#### Data Storage
MongoDB is the recommended database for this service, leveraging its flexible document-based structure to store stock 
entries per product, along with optional metadata like rack IDs or warehouse zones.
